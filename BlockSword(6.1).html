	<p>As you move to block the sword with your axe the force from the impact sends a wave of pain through your fatigued muscles, sending you crashing painfully to the ground. Lying on your back you blink your eyes open just in time to see the warrior you faced but moments ago drive his blade deep into your torso. As blood starts pooling its way up your throat and into your mouth you feel your consciousness fade and your vision turn to black.</p>
