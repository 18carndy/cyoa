	<p>You wake up to Haraldr shaking you from your slumber.</p>
	<p>"Get up!" he shouts inches from your face.</p>
	<p>He practically lifts you off the ground and is already pulling you towards where the gokstad is anchored.</p>
	<p>Trying to gain a semblence of understanding of the situation you quickly look around to see vikings clashed in battle with people in mail hauberks (metal rings interlocked to create a metal dress) and pointy metal helmets.</p>
	<p>Haraldr stops suddenly and you bump into his shoulder. Before you can curse him out you see in front of you two warriors, clad in the same mail as the ones currently fighting the other members of your crew.</p>
	<p> They're wielding swords in their right hands and bucklers (a small round shield) in their left and are currently splitting apart, one heading to the left the other to the right, attempting to circle around the two of you. Their bucklers and swords raise into a combat stance.</p>
	<p>"I'll take the one on the left, you take the one on the right." Haraldr says from beside you. You look towards the man on the right now brandishing his sword so that it is clear in view. You reach towards your belt and thank the gods that you had the foresight to sleep with your axe by your side. You pull it out from its place and move towards your attacker.</p>
	<p>The attacker suddenly bolts forward yelling out a warcry as he rushes forward, swing his sword in a wide arch.</p>
