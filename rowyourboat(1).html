	<p>With the rain still whipping your backs, you and your fellow vikings jump out of the gokstad and begin to fasten the boat to the ground with stakes and thick heavy rope. You almost leap out of the boat, finding a crevice in the stone where you plunge your stake into. You use the head of your axe to beat the stake further into the stone.</p>
	<p>You stand up and take in your surroundings, noting the thick treeline just 20 feet away from where you're currently standing. You turn back and look at your motley crew of warriors, all at least a couple of summers older than you.</p>
	<p>As the vikings finish fastening down the gokstad they rush past you heading for the safety of the trees. As you're about to head there yourself, you notice Haraldr is struggling with his stake and rope, seemingly unable to find a proper hold in the ground.
