	<p>You avoid the puddles and roots sticking out of the stony surface and head over to Haraldr. By the time you get there he seems to have at least have fastened the rope to the stake. He looks up as you approach and gives you a nod, shifting over as to give you room beside him.</p>
	<p>Together you're able to find a suitable place to plunge the stake into and make sure it's in there as well as you can manage. After securing the stake's footing, both of you quickly make your way into the forest.</p>
