	<p>You dodge left attempting to duck under his sword, however your tired limbs are unable to follow your lead and the warrior's sword instead catches you in the side. You give out a cry of pain as the sword slashes through skin and bone as the he retracts his blade. Looking down you see your yellow tunic now colored in a deep crimson, guts spilling from the wound like congealed milk from a bucket. You don't even have time to look up before the warrior's blade has connected with your neck, parting head from body.</p>
