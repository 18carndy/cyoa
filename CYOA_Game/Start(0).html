    <h1>The Great Raid</h1>
    <p>"Steel yourselves!" your captain bellows over the roaring sound of the crashing waves on wood.</p>
    <p>You are a viking on your first raid on foreign shores. At the ripe age of 16 years old, you were expected to join your shield-brothers to gain glory and riches in the lands of the British heathens. Currently, you're standing amongst your brothers-in-arms on a gokstad (a viking longboat) huddled together with your hands on oars and bracing yourselves against the elements.</p>
	<p>Another wave crashes against the stern and the wooden boat threatens to split in two under the impact. </p>
	<p>"I see land!" shouts Haraldr from beside you. You lean over the side of the ship and in the distance you can make a out a faint mass.</p>

	<p>"To the oars men!" yells the captain.</p>

    <a href='rowyourboat(1).html'>You grab your oar and start rowing like your life depended on it.</a>
