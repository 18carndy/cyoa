	<p>You tense your leg muscles like tightening a spring and then when you think you see an opening his defense you burst forward in a fearless action. When you're about five feet away from him you jump, bringing your axe over your head. You land your axe squarely on his shield, and a satisfying burst of wooden shrapnel explodes from the impact. You can't help but feel satisfied as you hear the exasperated grunt from the warrior, however that satisfaction soon turns into horror as you feel a cold sensation in your stomach. You look down and see his blade currently planted in your belly. He twists his sword and yanks back, causing you to stumble and fall on your back consciousness quickly escaping you. You take one last breath as the blood starts pooling around you.</p>
