	<p>You brush past a low-hanging treebranch and some underbrush before breaking through into a small clearing. The other vikings have already found places to sit and take a breath. Your captain, Ragnarr, is wringing out his damp clothes.</p>
	<p>You find a dry stone to sit on and take off your boots, now completely wet. As you pour out what seems like a bucket of water from them, you look up to see Haraldr break through the treeline.</p>
	<p>He tiredly moves towards where you are sitting and takes a seat on a stump beside you.</p>
