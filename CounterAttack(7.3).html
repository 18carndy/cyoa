  <body class="bg"><div>

	<p>You bend your knees, feeling the tension in your ligaments. The warrior is stops his circling and is now moving toward you. You intentionally let him see a gap in your defense, attempting to lure him in. He takes the bait, and launches himself at you. Just as he extends his swordarm you dodge right, avoiding his strike. With your free hand you grab his wrist and twist. He yelps out in pain and attempts to pull back his arm, however you bring your axe down on his now exposed forearm, cutting clean through skin, muscle, tendon, and bone.</p>
	<p>He screams in agony as his severed hand falls limp to the ground, the sword along with it. The warrior falls on his knees, his other arm clutching his bloody stump. He looks up at you in terror as you find yourself in charge of his fate.</p>

	<a href='LetLive(8.1).html'>It was a good fight. I kick his sword into the bushes and leave.</a> <br>
	<a href='QuickDeath(8.2).html'>He deserves a quick death.</a> <br>
